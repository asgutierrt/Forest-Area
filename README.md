System Dynamics project: Protected forest areas in Colombia

## Abstract:
The loss of biodiversity in Colombia can be analyzed
as a set of situations that affect the amount of
space that can be conserved. They include drug trafficking,
livestock, mining, among others. This analysis will be done through
system dynamics: it shows how all these factors
are related and impact the Protected Forest Areas that the State
can hold and care for. It is intended to be used as a starting point to envision solutions that reduce the
environmental impact caused by the loss of protected territory.
